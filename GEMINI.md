# GEMINI.md

This file provides context to Gemini when working with the `jmarket1` repository.

## `jmarket1` Project Overview

This is a JavaScript-based web application for visualizing financial market data. It is designed to work in conjunction with the `cryptosaba` C++ project, which performs data analysis and processing. `jmarket1` consumes the output of `cryptosaba` to render high-performance charts.

### Key Technologies
*   **JavaScript (ES Modules):** The core language for the project.
*   **SciChart:** A high-performance WebGL-based charting library for financial data visualization.
*   **esbuild:** A fast JavaScript bundler and minifier used for building the project.

### Architecture
*   **`index.html`:** The main entry point for the web application.
*   **`src/index.js`:** The main JavaScript entry point.
*   **`src/scenarios`:** Different visualization scenarios, each with its own chart configuration and data loading logic.
*   **`src/lib`:** Utility libraries for data reading and technical analysis.
*   **`js/`:** The output directory for bundled JavaScript files.

## Building and Running `jmarket1`

The project uses `npm` and `esbuild` for dependency management and building.

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install
```

**Build Commands:**
*   **Development:** To build the project and watch for changes, run:
    ```bash
    npm run bw
    ```
*   **Production:** To create a production build, run:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

**Running:**
After building, open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the application.

## Data Integration

`jmarket1` is designed to consume data generated by the `cryptosaba` project. This data is typically in a binary format and is read using custom data readers in the `src/lib/files` directory. The application then visualizes this data in various chart scenarios.

## Related Project: `cryptosaba`

`cryptosaba` is the C++ data analysis project that provides the data for `jmarket1`.

*   **Location:** `/home/payam/projects/cryptosaba/`
*   **Purpose:** A C++ application for high-frequency cryptocurrency trade data analysis and simulated trading.
*   **Technology:** C++23, CMake, Ninja.
